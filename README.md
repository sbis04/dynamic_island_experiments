# Dynamic Island Experiments

I'll be adding more dynamic island experiments here. For now there's just **Pull To Refresh** that is Dynamic Island aware ðŸ˜Ž.

> WIP: This is a very rough implementation and the code can be improved a lot ðŸ˜›

> **NOTE:** This is designed specially for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. You can try either on the physical device (if you own one), or use the Simulator. You need at least [Xcode 14.2 beta 2](https://developer.apple.com/download/applications/) to get access to the iPhone 14 Pro / iPhone 14 Pro Max Simulators (iOS 16.1).
